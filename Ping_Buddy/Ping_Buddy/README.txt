Ping Buddy

Ping Buddy is a C# WPF program that was created to assist with pinging other systems or websites for connectivity and to receive a visual confirmation of the feedback.  This program was created as a tool to help those who might not know enough about a computer to run pings themselves or for those who just don't want to go through a command line.

To use the program, you go to the bin/Release/ folder and open the EXE file.  Once the program has started, you can enter in the IP address of the system or website that you need to ping and click the "Ping IP Address" button.  

If the website returns pings, you will see a GREEN circle to the right of the text box.  

If the IP or input entered is not valid, you will see a YELLOW circle.

If the website does not respond to the ping, you will see a RED circle.


To get a better description of what the result is, check the checkbox to the left of the text box.  This will display if the connection is successful or not and if not, for what reason.
